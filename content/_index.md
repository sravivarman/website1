## <i class="fa-solid fa-book-open-reader"></i> Teaching Philosophy

> I view teaching as a process of developing strong conceptual foundations and
> connecting theory with real engineering systems.
>
> Understanding, not memorization, is the basis of meaningful learning.

Courses emphasize:
- Physical interpretation before formal analysis
- Multiple solution strategies
- Simulation as a tool for insight, not substitution
