## <i class="fa-solid fa-book-open-reader"></i> Teaching Philosophy

> I view teaching as a process of developing strong conceptual foundations and
> connecting theory with real engineering systems.  
>
> Understanding — not memorization — is the basis of meaningful learning.

My courses emphasize:
- Physical interpretation before formal analysis  
- Multiple solution strategies  
- Simulation as a tool for insight, not substitution
